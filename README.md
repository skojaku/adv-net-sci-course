# Basic Information
Welcome to the world of networks! Networks are all around us, from the vast expanse of the Internet to the intricate web of social connections that we build in our daily lives. But networks aren't just limited to the human realm---they can be found in every corner of natural world such as the complex interactions between animals, proteins, viruses, and DNAs. 

In recent years, we have witnessed remarkable advances in AI/ML, together with an ever-increasing volume and quality of data. Together, they offer an unprecedented opportunity to unlock the secrets of the world around us.
This course is an introduction to network data analysis from bottom up: through the interactions with network data and tools, we will learn how to store, manipulate, compute, and leverage network data in practice, as well as their underlying theoretical foundations.
