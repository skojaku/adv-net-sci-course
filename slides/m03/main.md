<div style="font-size:20pt;margin-top:-5%">

1. You will start up a social networking service and want to attract popular people to promote your service. Which of the following approaches is more likely to attract popular people as users? Explain why from the perspective of the friendship paradox.
   - **Waiting list**: Anyone can sign up for a waiting list and join the service on a first-come-first-served basis.
   - **Invitation**: Users can invite a given number of new users.

2. Create the Compressed Sparse Row Format of the undirected and unweighted network shown below with three arrays `indptr`, `indices` and `data`.

### Let's test the Friendship paradox

Average \# of friends
$$
(1 + 3 + 2 + 2)/4 = 2
$$
Average \# of friends *a friend has*
$$
(\underbrace{1}_{\text{Abby}} + \underbrace{3 +3 + 3}_{\text{Becca}} +  \underbrace{2 + 2}_{\text{Chloe}} + \underbrace{2 +2}_{\text{Deb}}) / 8 = 2.25
$$

## The friendship paradox is a ***mathematical*** fact

It is always true unless everyone has an equal number of friends.

**Why?**:
Popular individuals appear frequently in someone's friend list.

   - **Waiting list**: Anyone can sign up for a waiting list and join the service on a first-come-first-served basis.
   - **Invitation**: Users can invite a given number of new users.

**Answer**: The invitation-based approach is considered more effective as it takes advantage of the friendship paradox, which means that popular individuals are more likely to receive invitations through social contacts.

# <center style="margin-top:80px"> Why ü§î?</center>


---

<div style="font-size:22pt;margin-top:-5%">

First of all, let's create the adjacency list:

<center>

![bg width:100% right:30%](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/6n-graf.svg/800px-6n-graf.svg.png)

</center>

```
{
  1: [2,5],
  2: [1,3,5],
  3: [2,4],
  4: [3,5,6],
  5: [1,2,4],
  6: [4],
}
```

Then, create the CSR representation:
```
indices = [2,5,1,3,5,2,4,3,5,6,1,2,4,4]
indptr = [0,2,5,7,10,13,14]
data = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
```

</div>

---

- **ProsüôÇ**
  - Space efficient
    - Only takes $2m$ values, where $m$ is the number of non-zero entries.
  - Time efficient
    - Matrix product scales *linearly* by $m$ for sparse matrix üöÄ
    - Dense matrix scales with $n^2$ ($n$ = \# of nodes).
  - Efficient format for parallel computing

What are the *cons ü§î?*

---

- **Cons ü•≤**
  - Changes to the network structure are expensive.
    - E.g., Adding/deleting an edge requires to compile from scratch.
  - CSR is slow in column slicing, e.g.,
    ```
    A[1, :] # Row slicing is fast
    A[:, 1] # Column slicing is slow
    ```
  - CSC is slow in *row* slicing

---

<div style="font-size:28px">

- **Edge table**
  - üôÇ Portable & Space efficient. ü•≤ Inconvenient for computing
- **Adjacency matrix**

### Discussion

Translate the one-mode projection into a matrix operation.
  - Imagine a bipartite network consisting of $N_X$ nodes of mode $X$ (e.g., women) and $N_Y$ nodes of mode $Y$ (e.g., events).
  - Denoted by $B$ the $N_X\times N_Y$ adjacency matrix of the bipartite network, where $B_{xy}=1$ if nodes $x$ in mode $X$ and $y$ in mode $Y$ are connected. Otherwise, $B_{xy}=0$
  - Express the adjacency matrix $A_X$ of the network projected on $X$ using $B$. Self-loops are allowed.
  - Express $A_Y$ of the network projected on $Y$ by using $B$.

<div class="container">
<div class="col" style="flex:1;font-size:22px">

Hint: Consider a small bipartite network. Write $B$ and $A$. Think about how to compute $A_{ij}$ with $B_{xy}$. Then translate it into a matrix operation.

# Contagion vs Homophily


- **Homophily**
People with similar attributes tend to be connected with each other.


- **Contagion**
People change their attributes due to the connections to others people


## Homophily is about correlation.
## Contagion is about causation.

Homophily does not imply contagion:

![bg width:100% right:35%](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*Ppnv5uEDcYhzJbZa3AHcPg.png)

#### How it works
- Simulate random surfers who select hyperlinks in a page randomly
- Count the number of times a page is visited by the surfer.

#### Key idea
An important website should be at the center of the Web.

#### Discussion
Does PageRank always identify important webs? If not, why?
